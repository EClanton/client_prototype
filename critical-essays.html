    <h3 id="rcorners1" style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px; color: #636363"> <a href="contributors.html"target="_blank">Abstract By: Tabitha Barowsky</a></h3>
        
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 30px; color: #636363">What happens when a story is so close to the truth, it could easily be confused for fact? Many modern-day works of fiction walk this line. Telling real stories through fictional characters creates a genre of fiction that not only teaches audiences but inspires a sort of self-reflection that could not have otherwise been reached. In Charles Yu’s 2020 novel Interior Chinatown, readers follow the life of Willis Wu as he works his way up the acting ladder from background actor to special guest star. <a href="essays/Barowsky.pdf" download> This essay, entitled “The Interior,”</a>argues that by examining the idea, or rather myth, of the model minority and how it is used within different works, one can see how it has affected its characters and the larger discussion as a whole, ultimately realizing just how much art has come to imitate real life.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 30px; color: #636363">The essay <a href="essays/Burkhalter.pdf" download> “Asian Immigrants vs. America”</a> focuses on how Charles Yu used his 2020 novel Interior Chinatown to illustrate examples of racism towards Asian Americans. Not only does it talk about how the novel shows examples of racism against Asian Americans, but also shows current hate crimes and acts of racism as well, including during the COVID-19 outbreak. Along with showing current examples of these issues, the essay mentions that even in the 1850s, Asian Americans were dealing with the same problems. This essay notes that Asian Americans have been struggling with racism and hate crimes for a while.</p>
        
         <h3 id="rcorners1" style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px; color: #636363"><a href="contributors.html"target="_blank"> Abstract By: Mariah Crawford</a></h3>
        
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 30px; color: #636363"><a href="essays/Crawford.pdf" download>This research paper</a> discusses the ways in which stereotypes and generic depictions of Asian people are presented in across texts and media. Charles Yu critically examines the consequences of these stereotypes and challenges readers to reflect on the complexities of cultural identity, representation, and assimilation within the context of his novel Interior Chinatown. The author uses African American theory and Psychoanalytic theory as the primary theories of this essay to illustrate how stereotypes and generic “Asianness” have damaging effects on Asian Americans. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 30px; color: #636363">The essay <a href="essays/Cummins.pdf">“That Wasn’t Your Line – Shut Up!”</a> focuses on the roles we fill and scripts we follow in our daily lives - and how detrimental they can be for all involved. Utilizing Charles Yu’s novel Interior Chinatown as a focal point, the essay specifically narrows in on Asian Americans in film, and the stereotypes that the industry and media continues to perpetuate by selling these conventions to the masses.</p>

        <h3 id="rcorners1" style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px; color: #636363"> <a href="contributors.html"target="_blank">Abstract By: Rodrigo Laux</a></h3>
        
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 30px; color: #636363"><a href="essays/Laux.pdf">This research essay</a> examines racial discrimination against Asian Americans from a postcolonial and psychoanalytic perspective, examining the relationship between these theories and the novel Interior Chinatown in order to highlight the difficulties that Asian Americans must overcome in the United States.

        <h3 id="rcorners1" style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px; color: #636363"><a href="contributors.html"target="_blank"> Abstract By: Junior Pierre</a></h3>
        
        <p style="text-align: left; padding: 30px; color: #636363">Stereotyping, hate crimes, and misrepresentation within the United States are all under the umbrella of racism. Some people might think these are the only forms of racism or that all racism must be explicit acts of abuse or violence. However, there are other “quieter” forms of racism that can sometimes be even more damaging than the obvious forms. Racism can form a sense of self-rejection and or self-hatred, all residing in forms of racism that might not be as openly apparent; these include internalized racism, intra-racial racism, and interracial racism. Within <a href="essays/Pierre.pdf">This research essay</a> explores how, in Charles Yu’s Interior Chinatown, Willis Wu experiences these other "quieter" forms of racism in his journey toward becoming more than the limitations that society placed on him, and that he in turn placed on himself.</p>
